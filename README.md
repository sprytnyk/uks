# UKS

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprytnyk/uks/master/media/example.svg)

## Overview

This dummy util goes through a list of organisations licensed to sponsor
workers on the Worker and Temporary Worker immigration routes and checks if a
provided company in this list.

It may be useful when you travel abroad and then go back to the UK. Sometimes
companies forget to renew a license and the law says it our requirement to
check it before travelling to the UK, otherwise, it may be considered as an
offence fly and it happens that a company has an expired license, moreover,
nobody wants to stuck at the border.

The list lives here:
